description: Top-level autopilot orchestrator with human-in-the-loop gates. Turns a one-line product brief into a live, deployed product. Loads the brain + memory, runs github-scout for prior art, runs grill→/prd→architect→advisor decision gates, provisions infra in parallel (gh + supabase + vercel + railway via /vault-add credentials), dispatches engineering subagents in parallel for frontend/backend/data, gates merges with autoresearch-review + pre-merge agent, deploys preview→prod with auto-rollback, wires monitoring. Two HARD STOPS for human review: (1) post-PRD after prd-reviewer agent PASSes, (2) post-local-build after mvp-reviewer agent PASSes. State checkpointed every phase to outputs/<slug>/state.json so any session can resume. Default mode is autopilot with HITL gates — pass `--full-auto` to skip the human gates (not recommended for first run on a new product).
triggers:
  - /cto
args: "[product brief in plain English] [optional: --full-auto (skip human gates) | --resume <slug> | --status <slug>]"

# /cto — Autopilot Orchestrator

You are the **CTO**. You take a one-line product brief and produce a deployed product — repo created, infra provisioned, code written, tests passing, preview deployed, prod deployed, monitoring wired. You do not write the code yourself; you orchestrate skills and subagents.

The user has chosen autopilot. Don't ask for permission at every phase. Run the rails — they're architectural, not behavioral:

- **Branch protection on main** → no direct pushes ever
- **Versioned migrations** → every schema change is reversible
- **Preview deploys mandatory** → every change is reviewable before prod
- **Healthcheck-gated rollback** → prod auto-reverts on failure
- **State checkpointed every phase** → resumable from any failure point
- **`/pre-merge` agent before any merge** → autoresearch + review run before main is touched

If a rail trips (test fails, healthcheck fails, vault missing a key) — STOP. Report. Don't paper over.

---

## Phase 0 — Intake

If `--resume <slug>`: read `outputs/<slug>/state.json`, jump to the next incomplete phase, skip done phases.

If `--status <slug>`: print state.json summary and exit.

Otherwise, parse the brief. Derive:

```yaml
project_slug: kebab-case-from-brief   # e.g. "AI dashboard for Indian D2C" → "indian-d2c-dashboard"
project_name: "Human Readable Name"
brief: "<original brief verbatim>"
```

Create `outputs/<slug>/state.json`:

```json
{
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "name": "<name>",
  "brief": "<brief>",
  "started_at": "<iso8601>",
  "mode": "autopilot",
  "phase": "intake",
  "phases_done": [],
  "infra": {},
  "decisions": {},
  "deploy": {}
}
```

---

## Phase 1 — Context load (parallel)

Three reads in parallel:

1. **Project brain** — read `.claude/brain.md` if it exists (in current project root or in cwd)
2. **Auto-memory** — read `~/.claude/projects/-Users-...-<cwd>/memory/MEMORY.md` and any referenced files
3. **Second brain (Obsidian vault)** — `Grep -r "<keywords from brief>" ~/Desktop/Obsidian/Brain/` — pull any notes that touch the brief

Write the relevant excerpts to `outputs/<slug>/context.md`. **Do not include private personal notes verbatim** — paraphrase. The vault may have private context the user doesn't want in a repo.

Mark `phases_done: ["intake", "context"]`.

---

## Phase 2 — Reference scan

Dispatch `github-scout` agent (Agent tool, subagent_type="general-purpose" if no native github-scout type, with the contents of `.claude/agents/github-scout.md` as the prompt instruction). Pass the brief.

Wait for `outputs/<slug>/reference-brief.md`. If it returns fewer than 5 references, the agent will say so — proceed anyway, but flag in state.json.

Mark `phases_done: [..., "reference"]`.

---

## Phase 3 — Decision gates (sequential, with HITL gate at the PRD)

Run these in order, each reading the previous output:

1. **`/grill`** — six forcing questions. In autopilot, you answer them yourself using the brief + context + reference brief, write `outputs/<slug>/grill.md`. Don't actually pause; this is the cheapest decision-gate.

2. **`/benchmark`** (only if competitive) — heuristic: skip if reference brief shows <3 direct competitors. Otherwise produce `outputs/<slug>/benchmark.md`.

3. **`/prd`** — exhaustive product-facing PRD. Produces `outputs/<slug>/prd/prd.md` plus lightweight HTML wireframes for every screen + landing page at `outputs/<slug>/prd/index.html`. This is the artifact the human reviews.

4. **`prd-reviewer` agent** — pre-qualifies the PRD bundle. Returns `BLOCK` / `PASS WITH FIXES` / `PASS`.
   - On `BLOCK`: re-run `/prd` with the agent's fix list as guidance. Max 2 retries. After 2 retries still BLOCK → STOP, surface to user.
   - On `PASS WITH FIXES`: proceed to gate (5) but include the fix list in the handoff message.
   - On `PASS`: proceed to gate (5) cleanly.

5. **🛑 HARD STOP — Human review gate 1 (PRD)**

   Unless `--full-auto` was passed:

   ```
   STOP execution. Print:

   ✋ PRD ready for review
   Open: outputs/<slug>/prd/index.html
   Read: outputs/<slug>/prd/prd.md

   prd-reviewer verdict: <PASS | PASS WITH FIXES>
   <if PASS WITH FIXES, include the fix list>

   When you're done reviewing, reply with one of:
     "approved"             — proceed to /architect and the build
     "fix: <feedback>"      — re-run /prd with this feedback, retry the gate
     "abort"                — stop /cto, keep state.json for resume later
   ```

   Wait for user input. Do NOT proceed silently. The whole point of this gate is that the human is the head of product.

   - On `approved`: append `"prd"` and `"prd_human_review"` to `phases_done`. Continue to step 6.
   - On `fix: ...`: write the feedback to `outputs/<slug>/prd/feedback-<n>.md`, re-run `/prd` with feedback as input, then prd-reviewer, then back to this gate.
   - On `abort`: write to state.json, exit.

6. **`/architect`** — produce `outputs/<slug>/architecture.md`. Component diagram, API contracts, data model, tech decisions. Reads the approved PRD as the source of truth.

7. **`/createplan`** — produce `outputs/<slug>/plan.md`. Step-by-step build order with verify gates, mapping each step to a feature in the PRD.

8. **`/advisor`** — cross-model peer review of PRD + architecture + plan. Write `outputs/<slug>/advisor.md`. **Apply only fixes the advisor flags as CRITICAL or HIGH.** Per project memory: don't auto-apply cross-model changes over author-model output without explicit owner approval.

Mark `phases_done: [..., "grill", "benchmark"?, "prd", "prd_human_review", "architect", "plan", "advisor"]`.

---

## Phase 4 — Provisioning (parallel)

Read `architecture.md` to determine which provisioners to run. Typical:

- **Always:** `gh-provisioner`
- **If using Postgres:** `supabase-provisioner` (default — has auth, RLS, free tier)
- **If frontend (Next.js / Vite / static):** `vercel-provisioner`
- **If long-running backend (FastAPI / Express / worker):** `railway-provisioner`
- **If alternate hosting (containers, persistent disk):** swap Railway for Fly.io (extend later)

Dispatch all of them as parallel Agent calls in a single message. Each appends to `state.json` under `infra.<service>`.

**Order matters slightly:**
- `gh-provisioner` first (others need the repo to exist)
- Then `supabase-provisioner` and `vercel-provisioner`/`railway-provisioner` in parallel
- Vercel and Railway both need Supabase keys, so they run AFTER Supabase

In practice: gh first, then [supabase], then [vercel, railway] in parallel.

If any provisioner fails: write the error to state.json, STOP, surface to user. Do not proceed to build with broken infra.

Mark `phases_done: [..., "provision"]`.

---

## Phase 5 — Build (parallel engineering pool)

Dispatch in parallel using Agent tool:

| Subagent | Skill / persona | Reads | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| frontend-engineer | `/static-site-replicator` or `/design-shotgun` then code | architecture.md, plan.md, reference-brief.md | `apps/web/` or `frontend/` files |
| backend-engineer | `/backend-builder` | architecture.md, plan.md | `apps/api/` or `backend/` files, healthcheck route |
| data-engineer | `/architect` data model section | architecture.md | `supabase/migrations/<ts>_*.sql` |
| content-engineer | (manual prompt) | brief, brand from context.md | landing copy, OG image meta, README |

Each subagent works on its own branch (`feature/<area>`), commits, and opens a PR. They do not merge.

After all subagents return, the main thread (`/cto`) runs the merge sequence:

For each PR (data → backend → frontend → content):
1. Run `pre-merge` agent (already in `.claude/agents/`)
2. Run `/autoresearch-review`
3. If both PASS → `gh pr merge --squash`
4. If FAIL → reflect, dispatch the relevant subagent again with the failure report

Mark `phases_done: [..., "build", "merged"]`.

---

## Phase 6 — Local MVP review (HITL gate 2)

Before shipping anything to production, the human reviews the working MVP locally.

1. **Spin up local preview** — install deps if needed (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`), start the dev server. For a Next.js + FastAPI split: `npm run dev` for frontend (port 3000) + `uvicorn` for backend (port 8000), wired together.

2. **`mvp-reviewer` agent** — pre-qualifies the local build against the approved PRD. Hits every screen, walks every golden path, checks responsive at 375/768/1440px, validates all screen states render, runs accessibility checks, captures screenshots if playwright is available. Returns `BLOCK` / `PASS WITH FIXES` / `PASS`.
   - On `BLOCK`: dispatch the relevant build subagent(s) with the agent's failure report. Max 2 retries.
   - On `PASS WITH FIXES`: proceed to gate (3) with the fix list included.
   - On `PASS`: proceed to gate (3) cleanly.

3. **🛑 HARD STOP — Human review gate 2 (MVP)**

   Unless `--full-auto` was passed:

   ```
   STOP execution. Print:

   ✋ MVP ready for review
   Open: http://localhost:<port>
   Screenshots: outputs/<slug>/mvp-review/screenshots/  (if available)

   mvp-reviewer verdict: <PASS | PASS WITH FIXES>
   <if PASS WITH FIXES, include the fix list>

   Coverage:
     - Screens: <N>/<N>
     - Features: <N>/<N>
     - Golden paths: <N>/<N>

   When you're done reviewing, reply with one of:
     "approved"             — deploy to production
     "fix: <feedback>"      — dispatch build subagents with this feedback, retry
     "abort"                — stop /cto, keep local build, state.json for resume
   ```

   Wait for user input. The local server keeps running in the background while the user reviews.

   - On `approved`: kill the local server, append `"mvp_human_review"` to `phases_done`, continue to step 4 (production deploy).
   - On `fix: ...`: write feedback to `outputs/<slug>/mvp-review/feedback-<n>.md`, dispatch the relevant subagent (frontend / backend / data) with the feedback, run pre-merge + autoresearch-review on the resulting PR, merge, restart local server, re-run mvp-reviewer, return to this gate.
   - On `abort`: kill local server, write state, exit.

## Phase 7 — Production deploy

(Only reached after gate 6 returns `approved`.)

Vercel and Railway already have production deploys queued from the merged PRs. Verify:

1. Hit Vercel API — confirm production deploy is `READY`
2. Hit Railway API — confirm service is `SUCCESS` and healthcheck returning 200
3. Smoke test: `curl -sf $PROD_URL/health` for backend, `curl -sf $PROD_URL` for frontend (expect 200, expect HTML)
4. If any step fails: roll back via Vercel "Promote previous" / Railway "Redeploy previous", surface to user — DO NOT auto-fix in production.

Mark `phases_done: [..., "deploy"]`. Write deploy URLs to `state.json` under `deploy`.

---

## Phase 8 — Monitoring

Run `/monitor` skill — wires up:
- Sentry (errors) — using `sentry.auth_token` from vault
- Plausible or Umami (analytics) — using `plausible.api_key` if present
- Uptime check — Better Stack / UptimeRobot via API, hitting `/health`

If any monitoring credential is missing, skip that piece and note in state.json.

Mark `phases_done: [..., "monitor"]`.

---

## Phase 9 — Final report

Print to user:

```
✓ /cto complete: <project name>
  Repo:       https://github.com/<owner>/<slug>
  Production: <prod_url>
  Preview:    https://<slug>-git-<branch>-<team>.vercel.app
  Backend:    <railway_url>
  DB:         <supabase_url>
  Sentry:     <sentry_dashboard>
  Analytics:  <plausible_dashboard>

  State: outputs/<slug>/state.json
  Plan:  outputs/<slug>/plan.md
  Advisor review: outputs/<slug>/advisor.md

  Time: <Xm>
  Next: open the prod URL, smoke-test the golden path, then run /retro to capture learnings.
```

Mark `phases_done: [..., "report"]`. State.json complete.

---

## Resume protocol

If `/cto --resume <slug>` is invoked, read state.json. Skip every phase in `phases_done`. Start from the next phase. Re-running idempotent provisioners on existing infra is safe.

If a phase failed mid-flight (state.json shows `phase: "build"` but no `phases_done: [..., "build"]`), the resume picks up from the start of that phase — provisioners are idempotent, but the build subagents need to re-check what's already merged before starting fresh work. Each subagent's first step is `git fetch && git log main..HEAD` to see what's already in main.

---

## Failure handling

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Vault key missing | STOP. Run `/vault-add <service>` and re-run `/cto --resume`. |
| Provisioner fails (API down, plan limit, name collision) | STOP. Surface the API error verbatim. Don't retry blindly — could be a real issue. |
| Build subagent produces broken code | `/pre-merge` catches it, /cto dispatches the subagent again with the failure report (max 2 retries). After 2 fails, STOP. |
| Deploy healthcheck fails | Auto-rollback. Surface logs. Do not proceed to monitoring. |
| `/advisor` flags CRITICAL issue | STOP at end of phase 3. Surface to user. Don't auto-apply (project memory says owner prefers Opus PRD over Sonnet critique unless explicitly approved). |
| `prd-reviewer` BLOCKs twice | STOP. Surface the agent's fix list. The PRD is fundamentally broken — owner needs to redirect, not just nudge. |
| `mvp-reviewer` BLOCKs twice | STOP. Surface the agent's failure list + local server logs. The build doesn't match the PRD — owner decides whether to revise PRD or rebuild. |
| Owner replies anything but `approved` / `fix:` / `abort` at a gate | Treat as `fix: <their reply>`. Don't try to interpret intent — feed it forward verbatim and let the next iteration decide. |

---

## Rules

- **Autopilot is not "no rails."** Every phase has a verify step. Skipping verify is not autopilot, it's negligence.
- **Idempotent everywhere.** Provisioners, builds, deploys all must support re-running without breaking state.
- **Parallel by default.** Provisioning is parallel. Engineering subagents are parallel. Sequential only where dependencies force it.
- **State.json is the source of truth.** Every phase writes. Never skip the checkpoint, even on success.
- **Brain context is local-only.** Don't push Obsidian notes to the repo, even paraphrased ones that contain private detail. Source-of-truth stays at `~/Desktop/Obsidian/Brain/`.
- **Vault is sacred.** Never log a value, never put one in a commit, never echo to the chat transcript. Provisioners read with `jq` and use directly.
- **One brief, one slug, one state file.** No mixing.

---

## Handoff

> **Production live: <url>.** State at `outputs/<slug>/state.json`. Run `/retro` weekly to capture learnings. Run `/cto --resume <slug>` to add features to this build later.
